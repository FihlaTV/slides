## Many possibilities...

---

### Which One To Pick ?

- Too many possibilities, can't code them all
- Should focus on the experience
- Not on coding support for each VR devices

---

### Which One To Pick ?

- Discard the exotic ones
- Focus on the popular ones
- i.e. occulus, cardboard, and plain phone

**All done in WebVR Boilerplate. GREAT!**

---

### What Is The WebVR Boilerplate ?

- Support all popular VR devices
- i.e. occulus, google cardboard, and plain phone
- [WebVR Boilerplate](https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate) code available on github
- Reuse it, so you can focus on your own stuff

---

### WebVR Boilerplate: a Safe Choice 

- Described as "Responsive WebVR, headset optional"
- Made by [Boris Smus](https://twitter.com/borismus) at google - [post](http://smus.com/responsive-vr/)
- Apply [Responsive Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) principle
