### What we are gonna talk about ?

- Augmented Reality obviously
- jsartoolkit - javascript version of artoolkit
- All that in javascript in your browser

---

### Web based vs Native code

- Native code is faster
- It is harder and longer to write
- It requires multiple versions for multiple plateforms

---

### Pro Web Based

- Single code for all plateforms
- 

--- 

### jsartoolkit history

- [github repository](https://github.com/artoolkit/jsartoolkit5)
- license [LGPLv3](https://github.com/artoolkit/jsartoolkit5/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) : the same
as artoolkit

# Performances

---

### Current measures

- 30 fps on a desktop (macbook pro)
- 3 fps on a mobile (gasp :( )

---

# Possible Improvements

---

### Use WebWorkers

- WebWorkers are threads for web pages
- Thus use multiple processors

**More power available for artoolkit to detect markers**

---

### Compile in WebAssembly

- jsartoolkit currently in asm.js
- asm.js is backward compatible with javascript

---

### Compile in WebAssembly

- WebAssembly will be faster
- how much ? unsure :(
- less time parsing
- WebAssembly is cleaner than asm.js so easier to optimize

---

### Futures of jsartoolkit

- try to improve performances
- support of textures tracking
